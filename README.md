Generate [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas (v3) from Typescript types generated by the Supabase CLI.

> [!NOTE]  
> @dohoo forked this project and created SupaZod. It's a significant improvement, and I recommend trying it out instead: https://github.com/dohooo/supazod


## Usage

```sh
$ pnpm add --D supabase-to-zod
$ supabase gen types typescript --local > types.ts
$ pnpm supabase-to-zod --input types.ts --output schemas.ts
```

That's it, go to `schemas.ts` file, you should have a schema for all tables, views, enums and functions.

## Authors Note
This project was created in a few hours during the Launchweek VI hackathon and the approach is **very** hacky: It transforms the nested `Database` type generated by the Supabase CLI into flat types, and passes them through `ts-to-zod` to generate zod schemas. A proper solution would be using the pg-meta API to generate zod schemas directly from the source of truth, similar to how the Typescript types are generated.
